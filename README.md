# Inventory-networks-optimizing-based-on-the-guaranteed-service-model
Optimization of inventory on a large-scale inventory network is challenging since it might involve huge nodes and lots of shared materials. Two critical issues are: 
- choosing which nodes to place inventory 
- how much to set

The guaranteed service model (GSM) is one of the main approaches to optimize inventory policy on networks.
This library provides several approaches to solve the guaranteed service model (GSM) to optimize inventory policy on networks.
