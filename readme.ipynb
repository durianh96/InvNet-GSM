    "Other seven approaches of solving GSM are provided in this library: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic programming (GW-DP)** from (Graves and Willems 2000).\n",
    "  This approach was designed for tree networks; it takes advantage of the fact that in any tree, each node can be labeled with a unique index such that every node except one has at most one adjacent node with an index higher than its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heuristic general networks algorithm (HGNA)** from (Humair and Willems 2011).\n",
    "  This paper combines the GW-DP algorithm with a branch-and-bound scheme and provides an exact solution approach called the **general networks algorithm (GNA)**.\n",
    "  GNA can find optimal solutions for general networks, but takes a long time to find the solution for large-scale problems (the authors provide an example 2,025-node problem that takes 577,190.78 seconds to find the optimal solution). The authors also provide two faster heuristics: **HGNA** and **TGNA**. \n",
    "  HGNA is motivated by the structure of the formulation's dual space, whereas TGNA simply terminates the optimization algorithm after a fixed number of iterations.\n",
    "  We found that compared with TGNA, HGNA takes a long time to find solutions to large-scale problems but is able to find a lower-cost solution.  \n",
    "  We add a parameter *max iter num* to terminate HGNA after a fixed number of iterations, like TGNA. \n",
    "  With larger *max iter num*, the quality of the solution will be higher, while the solution time will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Piecewise linear approximation (PWL)** from (Magnanti et al. 2006).\n",
    "  This approach uses piecewise linear functions to approximate the GSM's objective function. This turns the original GSM into a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem that can be solved with an MIP solver. We will terminate the solver and return the results when the gap between the lower and upper objective bounds is less than *opt gap*, times the absolute value of the incumbent objective value.\n",
    "  With smaller *opt gap*, the quality of the solution will be higher, while the solution time will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic sloping (DS)** and **iterative mixed integer programming (IMIP)** from (Shu and Karimi 2009). \n",
    "  This paper provides two efficient iterative heuristics, DS and IMIP. The DS uses continuous approximation, while the IMIP employs a two-piece linear approximation to approximate the concave objective function. Accordingly, the DS needs to solve a linear problem and the IMIP needs to solve a MIP problem iteratively.  In their numerical studies, the IMIP outperforms the DS in solution quality consistently and the latter outperforms the former in solution speed consistently. A noteworthy feature of these two approaches is that the quality of solutions does not deteriorate with an increase in network size.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulated annealing (SA)** from (Grahl et al. 2016).\n",
    "  This paper investigates the performance of three meta-heuristics, local search, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing on solving GSM. SA outperforms the other two meta-heuristics with respect to speed and solution quality. \n",
    "  Therefore we choose SA as a representative of meta-heuristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple sequential linear programming (Simple-SLP)** from (Huang et al. 2022).\n",
    "  In the ID approach, if the underlying graph can not be decomposed, we then simply output the local solution with the smallest total inventory cost. \n",
    "  We can also apply this approach directly to solve for GSM without decomposition.\n",
    "  We call this approach **Simple-SLP**. The parameter *local sol num* stands for how many local solutions need to be found. With larger *local sol num*, more local solutions will be found.\n",
    "  Therefore, the possibility of finding a lower-cost solution will also be higher. "
